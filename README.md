## What is LeetPaint

LeetPaint is a browser extension designed specifically for LeetCode users. It's a paint tool that can be used to visually represent coding problems through drawings, empowering problem solving. This extension is integrated within any LeetCode problem page where the tool can be launched with a click of a button (placed on the bottom right). 

Drawing and visualising problems is a highly recommended strategy within the coding community, especially as discussed in numerous Reddit threads focused on LeetCode and coding challenges. Of course, LeetCode doesn't have an integrated tool for this, and using external paint tools can be cumbersome to continuously switch back and forth between tabs. LeetPaint was made to provide a simple, user-friendly interface that allows users to paint and annotate directly on the same page as they solve coding problems.

## Key Features

- **Intuitive Interface**: Designed for ease of use, LeetPaint offers a clean and accessible interface that lets users focus on problem-solving without distractions.

- **Flexible Drawing Tools**: Paintbrush tool with colour and brush size selection, an eraser tool to remove paint strokes, undo/redo functionality to go back on forth on paint strokes, clear canvas option to remove everything at once.

- **Image Upload Support**: Users can drag and drop images onto the canvas, allowing for enhanced visual aids and context in their problem-solving process.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Built as a browser extension, LeetPaint can be accessed from any computer by installing this extension with a web browser.
